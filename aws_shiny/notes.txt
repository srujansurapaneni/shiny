1. when you update the data feed/datasets for the app, a full stop and restart of shiny-server is required. 
2. code ksh/other to look for the timestap of data feeds and datasets and run the stop and restart scripts
3. 


ALGORITHM FLOW:
---------------
1. identify stopwords
2. define regex
3. convert all stop words to an array
4. split a string into an array based on sentences based on sentence ending with ./?/! or other punctuations and convert all to lower case
5. make a list of words other than stopwords and their counts (number of times they appear)
6. based on 5, rank the top "10"
7. Based on 5, look in 4 and tag/attach ranks from 6 to sentences in 4
8. use fuzzy match to compare all the sentences obtained in 7 and delete if any redundancies
9. remove extra spaces from the input text
10. after summarization, include a paraphrasing algorithm
